When each version is encoded, your webhook will get a notification.  It will look like ```{ \\\"type\\\": \\\"video.encoding.quality.completed\\\", \\\"emittedAt\\\": \\\"2021-01-29T16:46:25.217+01:00\\\", \\\"videoId\\\": \\\"viXXXXXXXX\\\", \\\"encoding\\\": \\\"hls\\\", \\\"quality\\\": \\\"720p\\\"} ```. This request says that the 720p HLS encoding was completed. * ```live-stream.broadcast.started```  When a live stream begins broadcasting, the broadcasting parameter changes from false to true, and this webhook fires. * ```live-stream.broadcast.ended```  This event fires when the live stream has finished broadcasting, and the broadcasting parameter flips from false to true. * ```video.source.recorded```  Occurs when a live stream is recorded and submitted for encoding.
